  `mark6-image` offers a wide range of possibilities to display images cleaner
  than with the native <img> tag. For example, the aspect defines the size of an
  image before the src is loaded.
---

# Image

```markup
<mark6-image [aspectRatio]="16 / 9"
             src="https://dummyimage.com/1920x1080/000/fff.jpg">
</mark6-image>
```

| Element | Description |

| &lt;mark6-image&gt; | The image itself |
